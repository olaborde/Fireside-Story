# Fireside-Story

Getting Ready: Code Together
Coding together allows you to work as a team so you can build bigger projects, faster.

In this studio, we will practice common git commands necessary when multiple people are developing on the same code base. Today, you will start out coding in tag-team shifts, and by the end you should have a good idea of how to both be working on the same code at the same time. You will learn how to:

Quickly add Code in Pull + Push Cycles (Important! This is the fundamental process we'll be practicing!)
Add a Collaborator to a GitHub Project
Sharing Repositories on GitHub
Create a Branch in Git
Create a Pull Request in GitHub
Resolve Merge Conflicts
This lesson reinforces

Creating Repositories
Cloning Repositories
Working with Git Concepts: Staging, Commits, and Status
Walkthrough
The instructor will discuss why GitHub is worth their study. You already know how to use a local git repository with one branch, giving you the ability to move your code forward and backward in time. Working with branches on GitHub allows multiple people to build features at the same time. Pull Requests act as a checkpoint when code flows from branch to branch.

Students must pair off for this exercise. If you have trouble finding a partner, ask your TF for help.

Studio
We are going to play a game. We will play it just like you'd play around a campfire, but on a web page.

First, find a new friend to play the game with.

Feel free to share your story in the #showcase channel on Slack, and see what others have created!

You and your partner will alternate tasks, so designate one of you as Player 1 and the other as Player 2. Even when it is not your turn to complete a task, read and observe what your partner is doing to completed theirs. The steps here mimic how a real-world collaborative Git workflow can be used within a project.
